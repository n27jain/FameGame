People compete for fame on every social media platform. They like every post they see in hopes that the other person will return the favour.This app is designed to trace those people and their behaviours. The twist? The participant that gets the most likes will be awarded $100. I made this app using Flutter and Firebase.

Checkout out the orginal project in android native: [Social Media]. I plan to make a fully native objective-c app for IOS once I conduct the expirement on android users first. 

## Project API's and Technologies:
  - [VS Code] (IDE)
  - [Firebase] (API) (RealTime DataBase) (Virtual Storage) (Authentication)
  - [Flutter] (Dart)(Cross-Platform Developtment)(IOS + ANDROID)

## Objectives

This app's primary was focus to create an interesting and private social media app for the developer and his friends. The future focus is to release the app for all users. Right now it is expected to be a social expirement to see who is will become the most popular person in the platform where there are limited and restricited users.

There are 5 phases to be implemented for the completion of the project.

**Phase 1:** Create the shell App with different screens/widgets

**Phase 2:** Create beautify the UI and focus purely on the front end.

**Phase 3:** Insert a game into the app using Unity. (Another side project).

**Phase 4:** Induce a Karma system into the social media app and make it competitive. 

**Phase 5:** Secure app and then release. (Limit Users to save data consumption).

**NEW PHASE 6:** Release the social expirement game.

## Rules of the game:
  - Room of 100 people
  - Each person can only vote 5 times a day and only once per post
  - No one can see who vote for whom, and once a vote has been placed the person who placed it cannot change it and cannot view their vote. 
  - Karma system is put in place to rank the top player
  - At the end of the month the person with the most karma gets $100
